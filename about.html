        <p>[I discovered my interest in teaching during the training and mentorship of apprentice carpenters in my previous role as a builder. Guiding their learning and development as tradesmen; became a highlight of my twenty-three-year career. I have always had a passion for art and painting, previously focusing this talent on the design of many of the homes I built. My background and interests have produced a unique mix of skills, combining practicality and creativity, which I think has been valuable preparation for teaching Visual Arts and Design Technology. I believe in the necessity and value of vocational education, having experienced this pathway personally, whilst also achieving at a high level academically, resulting in a program GPA of 6.5 in my Bachelor of Education degree. With this experience, I feel confident that I can offer students valuable insight to help them reach their potential.]</p>
