    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="AITSI_image.png" alt="AITSI Thematic Image" class="center-img">
    <p>Despite being assessed during my final professional experience placement as demonstrating standard 1.4 at the graduate level, and standard 2.4 exceeding graduate level, I believe the importance of these standards necessitates further elaboration to demonstrate my developing competence in understanding and addressing the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and incorporating Indigenous perspectives within curriculum delivery.</p>

    <h2>First Australians and the Education System</h2>
    <p>In this section, I have linked a portfolio documenting my development of a greater awareness of issues surrounding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education through a series of personal reflections at the end of each module, completed during the ‘First Australians and the Education System’ course in the final year of my degree. Through engaging with this course I have become more mindful of the great responsibility teachers have to all students, including those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, and the potential difference that role can make. I am now more aware of the importance of implementing Indigenous perspectives regardless of the fear of making mistakes. Parents and community are clearly the greatest resources for implementing culturally appropriate curriculum within local contexts and provide valuable insight into the students’ individual strengths and talents. By taking a strength-based approach that values diversity, Indigenous epistemologies, and pedagogies, the classroom has greater potential to become a third cultural space, enriching the education of all students, and by extension creating a more tolerant and informed society.</p>

    <h2>Lesson resource incorporating Indigenous perspectives and strategies</h2>
    <p>I have attached an assignment completed during my university study that required us to take an existing lesson plan without Indigenous content or pedagogies and incorporate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives with consideration of involving parents/carers and the community (APST 1.4, 2.4, 3.7). This involved consulting with community and a variety of resources to design a lesson with a highly relevant and local context for Queensland students. The resulting lesson combines The Eight Ways of Aboriginal Learning framework of narrative-driven and place-based learning with occidental perspectives. The lesson addresses cross-curriculum priorities as Indigenous students are able to have their identity and culture reflected in their learning and promotes respect and reconciliation among all students. The document is annotated in relation to the standards addressed.</p>
